# CatNet - Cat Image Classifier

CatNet is a simple machine learning project that classifies images as either a cat or not a cat using logistic regression. The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and non-cats, preprocessed and used to train a binary classification model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Loads and preprocesses the dataset (resizing, normalizing, and flattening images)

- Implements Logistic Regression from scratch

- Includes training, optimization, and prediction functions

- Provides test evaluations on new images

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

- 209 training images (64x64 RGB images)

- 50 test images (64x64 RGB images)

- Labels: 1 for cat, 0 for non-cat

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

- Achieves high accuracy in detecting cats using a basic logistic regression approach.

- You can improve the model by implementing deep learning using neural networks (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras).
